# LocalPathPlanning_DDPG
self-driving car learning Local path planning with DDPG agent.


MATLAB R2020b
- Automated driving toolbox (DrivingScenarioDesigner - Export it as a matlab function - make Scenario1 at workspace)
- Reinforcement learning toolbox


main file = localpathplanning_DDPG2.m
Simulink env file = new_lpp_sim_matfile.slx
best_model = savedAgentsfinalAgent

Make sure busActor1 always exists in the workspace before learning
After typing drivingScenarioDesigner into the command window, you can open the temp_lpp_env file.
